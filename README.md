# secure-traffic
This is about a project I did on the importance of using a secure protocol(HTTPS) to prevent data leackages during a cyber-attack.

Now the project mainly focuses on checking on how secure data is when the protocol HTTP and HTTPS are of concern. I used a flask(python) server to run a student school portal website. One server runs the normal HTTP traffic and another server runs HTTPS traffic.
So we have two folders; the one labeled "no encryption"; the server uses http traffic
The one labelled "with encryption"; the server uses https traffic protocol.
